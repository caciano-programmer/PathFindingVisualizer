# Path Finding Visualizer

An app to visualize and interact with path finding algorithms.

Some of the things you can do with this app:
  * Choose one of five algorithms and see the path it takes in real time to reach the destination
  * Create obstacles for the algorithm to traverse through
  * Create weighted paths for elegible algorithms
  * Generate a randomized maze for traversal at the click of a button
  * View the algorithm code

To run this locally simply download the code, install neccessary depenedency packages, and then it can be
run with the simple command "npm start". Will display on localhost port 3000.
